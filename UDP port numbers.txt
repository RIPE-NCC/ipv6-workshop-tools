Numbering for UDP ports for connections between lab segments
------------------------------------------------------------

Structure for manual port numbers:
{FUNCTION}{LOCACTION}{SIDE}{ROUTER}{PORT}

FUNCTIONS:
1: ISP network
2: Customer network
5: Auto-generated UDP ports

LOCATIONS:
0: Core switches
1: POP 1
2: POP 2
3: POP 3
4: POP 4
5: POP 5
6: POP 6
7: POP 7
8: POP 8
9: POP 9

SIDE:
0: Reserved for Console and Aux
1: Core switch side
2: POP router side
3: Customer router side

ROUTERS:
1 ≤ ROUTER ≤ 9

PORTS for network connections:
0 ≤ PORT ≤ 9
The SIDE with the lowest value determines the port
If both SIDEs are equal the lowers LOCATION number determines the port
If both SIDEs and LOCATIONs are equal the lowest ROUTER number determines the port

PORTS for console and aux:
0: Console
1: Aux
